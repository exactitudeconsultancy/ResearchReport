<h3>Discover the new level of versatility in the digital instrument cluster</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital instrument cluster makes it possible to present a wide variety of information to the driver that is adapted dynamically to suit the current driving situation. The digital cluster is ideal for a wide range of possible application scenarios, including conventional tachometer displays, function displays, route planning graphics, or displaying video from a rear-view camera,</p>
<p>The driver is always shown exactly the right information when needed. That ensures less distraction and helps reduce the accident risk. The information is very easy to read in all situations, thanks to the display&rsquo;s outstanding resolution. The user interface (HMI) can be personalized and easily adapted to different vehicle models and markets due to its versatile core design.</p>
